### Solution 1: Check Network Connection 

 The first thing that you should think of is your network connection. Open a webpage on your browser to see if it works. Afterwards, connect to the iTunes Store.

1\. If your computer is unable to connect to network, turn off Wi-Fi connection and re-start your Wi-Fi router several minutes later.

2\. There is no problem with Wi-Fi connection but the error message still shows up when you connect to iTunes Store. Dig out effective solutions to possible iTunes errors (1671, -50, -23, -1...).

3\. In case your iTunes Store can be opened but it displays a blank white page, change to a stronger Wi-Fi network or identify & remove layered service provider software.

### Solution 2: Update or Restore your iPhone without iTunes 

You can't successfully update or restore your iPhone unless you resort to iTunes when you forget your password, your iPhone is locked or iPhone is in recovery mode. Otherwise, you can choose to update/restore your iPhone without iTunes like the below OTA method:

**Step 1:** Unplug your iPhone from your Mac/Windows computer.

**Step 2:** Make sure you have a stable Wi-Fi network connection. You're not suggested to use cellular data or personal hotpot, cuz they're not strong enough or stable. Then, open your iPhone and enable Wi-Fi thereon.

**Step 3:** Head to Settings on your iPhone > tap General > click Software Update.
