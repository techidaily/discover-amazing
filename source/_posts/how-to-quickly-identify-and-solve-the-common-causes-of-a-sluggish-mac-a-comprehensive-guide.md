### MacOS

![mac running slow after update](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac/article-image/mac-slow-1.jpg) 

**1\. Outdated MacOS.**   
 No doubt about that - An older MacOS typically runs slower. That's why Apple releases a new MacOS every year or so (to date, it's macOS Ventura) and encourage users to [upgrade to MacOS Ventura](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macxdvd.com%2Fmac%2Fhow-to-update-macos.htm). Don't think of it as adding more junk to your already slow Mac - think of it as new software that makes your Mac run more smoothly. And if for some reason your Mac running slow after update, don't panic. It could happen that disk permissions are broken. See[how to speed up Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)right here.

 Actually, Apple supplies firmware updates from time to time. Although only a few people have troubles after firmware installed, it does make Mac running slow among other issues. 

**3\. Permission conflicts or damage.**  
 If the permissions on your Mac computer hard drive are damaged, everything will slow down, not to mention the unusual behavior on your Macbook, iMac etc. To get this Mac running slow problem fixed originated from permission errors, you can go Disk Utility. 

**4\. Unused System Preference Panes.**  
 Do you know that even if your System Preference Panes no longer used can still take up valuable CPU, memory and disk space, thus make your Mac running slow a little bit. Once you remove these unused items, you can speed up your slow Mac slightly. 

### ![](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac/../seoimage/fix.png) Mac Running Slow Fixes: Update to the Latest OS, Maintenance/Optimize it

**5\. Lack of memory (RAM).**   
 This is probably the most critical cause that leads to a slow Mac. If you find your Mac runs slow, the first thing comes to check the memory space. The less RAM your Mac computer left, the slower your Mac will be. And an application you're using may require more memory than your computer has easily available. 

**6\. Underpowered processor.**  
 Apple doesn't always allow you to choose the processing power you want. If you use your Mac for heavy tasks, like encoding videos or dealing with 3D modeling, then a less powerful processor can certainly contribute to a lag in the Mac's performance. For example, when you convert videos with [MacX Video Converter Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), you can choose up to 8-core CPU utility to speed up your video conversion on Macbook, iMac etc. 

![mac runs slow](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac/article-image/mac-slow-3.jpg) 

**7\. Failed HDD or SSD.**

You're highly suggested to install a new GPU to speed up the slow Mac. BTW, you can check whether your graphics card is outdated in About This Mac > Graphics. 

**9\. Limited Storage Space.**   
It's inevitable that you saved many huge video files, thousands of photos and music tracks, or other large files on your Mac computer. Then day by day, you get a slow Mac. Nothing slows a Mac more than a full hard drive. And the first 50% of the drive is faster than the second 50% due to larger sectors and longer tracks which the heads have less to move and can gather more data at one time. So to speed up a slow Mac, you can try to [free up space on Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/). 

### ![](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac/../seoimage/fix.png) Mac Running Slow Fixes: Safe, Easy and Affordable Hardware Upgrades (RAM, SSD, GPU)

**16\. iCloud Sync.**   
Similar to iTunes, Apple iCloud syncing can also decelerate performance. It can also cause several other linked services such as email, Photos, FindMyiPhone, etc. to run slowly. 

**17\. Apple mail crashes.**   
The mail inbox is the other thing that many Mac users let spiral out of control. If you can't remember the last time you spent an afternoon deleting old emails, then it's not surprising that you experience an extremely slow speed when you launch your Mail application.
