**1\. Outdated MacOS.**   
 No doubt about that - An older MacOS typically runs slower. That's why Apple releases a new MacOS every year or so (to date, it's macOS Ventura) and encourage users to [upgrade to MacOS Ventura](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macxdvd.com%2Fmac%2Fhow-to-update-macos.htm). Don't think of it as adding more junk to your already slow Mac - think of it as new software that makes your Mac run more smoothly. And if for some reason your Mac running slow after update, don't panic. It could happen that disk permissions are broken. See[how to speed up Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)right here.

**2\. Corrupted or wrong firmware.**  
 Actually, Apple supplies firmware updates from time to time. Although only a few people have troubles after firmware installed, it does make Mac running slow among other issues. 

**3\. Permission conflicts or damage.**  
 If the permissions on your Mac computer hard drive are damaged, everything will slow down, not to mention the unusual behavior on your Macbook, iMac etc. To get this Mac running slow problem fixed originated from permission errors, you can go Disk Utility. 

**4\. Unused System Preference Panes.**

### Hardware

![mac running slow](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac/article-image/mac-slow-2.jpg) 

**5\. Lack of memory (RAM).**   
 This is probably the most critical cause that leads to a slow Mac. If you find your Mac runs slow, the first thing comes to check the memory space. The less RAM your Mac computer left, the slower your Mac will be. And an application you're using may require more memory than your computer has easily available. 

**6\. Underpowered processor.**  
 Apple doesn't always allow you to choose the processing power you want. If you use your Mac for heavy tasks, like encoding videos or dealing with 3D modeling, then a less powerful processor can certainly contribute to a lag in the Mac's performance. For example, when you convert videos with [MacX Video Converter Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), you can choose up to 8-core CPU utility to speed up your video conversion on Macbook, iMac etc. 

![mac runs slow](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac/article-image/mac-slow-3.jpg) 

**7\. Failed HDD or SSD.**   
 A hard drive failure not only endangers the data you've stored on the Mac, it also makes your computer sluggish, or even worse, it won't work at all. If you do have enough memory, but your Mac running slow or crashing regularly, you HDD or SSD drive might be on the way of failing. 

**8\. Outdated graphics card.**  
 If you regularly use your Mac for gaming, you may find the overall experience a bit choppy. This is probably because your Mac is equipped with an older GPU. You're highly suggested to install a new GPU to speed up the slow Mac. BTW, you can check whether your graphics card is outdated in About This Mac > Graphics. 

**9\. Limited Storage Space.**   
It's inevitable that you saved many huge video files, thousands of photos and music tracks, or other large files on your Mac computer. Then day by day, you get a slow Mac. Nothing slows a Mac more than a full hard drive. And the first 50% of the drive is faster than the second 50% due to larger sectors and longer tracks which the heads have less to move and can gather more data at one time. So to speed up a slow Mac, you can try to [free up space on Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/). 

### ![](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac/../seoimage/fix.png) Mac Running Slow Fixes: Safe, Easy and Affordable Hardware Upgrades (RAM, SSD, GPU)

You see, RAM and SSD affect your Mac speed greatly. It's quite easy to get your startup disk full, then Mac running slow follows.

So with new technology constantly coming out you can affordably invest in a new RAM for your MacBook, iMac or even upgrade to an SSD for your Mac computer. 

### Software/Apps

![mac slowing down](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac/article-image/mac-slow-4.jpg) 

**10\. Web browsers full of junk files.**  
 We use web browser every day, regardless of Chrome, Safari, Firefox. And these browsers save your browsing history, caches, plugins, extensions automatically. As the day to day work, these files will take a lot of storage space of your Mac so as to impact the web page loading speed.

**12\. Virus Infection.**   
Generally, the possibility that your Mac is affected with virus is much more smaller than Windows PCs. But there is no absolutely safe computer. As Mac computers gain market share and are used by an increasing number of people, virus are getting more common than it used to be, which make Mac running slow indeed. 

**13\. Unused or illegal software.**   
There is a lot of bad software out there. If you download applications with unverified developers, or from non-authorized sites, chances are these applications can make your Mac slower by unnecessarily hogging the CPU or RAM.

**14\. Time Machine backup in process.**  
 As you know, the Time Machine backup always takes a long time, especially for the first [Mac backup to external hard drive](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/).

**15\. Improper iTunes installation or setting.**  
Every time I connect my iPhone, iPad to Mac, the[iTunes not working](https://www.macxdvd.com/mobile/itunes-not-working-fixed.htm
) and my Mac started to freeze. Is it just me? I finally find it turned out that I'd enabled the auto-sync in iTunes settings. Once I disabled it, it's gotta okay. An improper iTunes setting may cause Mac slowing down as well. 

**16\. iCloud Sync.**   
Similar to iTunes, Apple iCloud syncing can also decelerate performance. It can also cause several other linked services such as email, Photos, FindMyiPhone, etc. to run slowly. 

**17\. Apple mail crashes.**   
The mail inbox is the other thing that many Mac users let spiral out of control. If you can't remember the last time you spent an afternoon deleting old emails, then it's not surprising that you experience an extremely slow speed when you launch your Mail application. To speed up a slow Mac in such situation, try to get into the habit of going through your Mailbox from time to time and deleting messages you no longer need.
