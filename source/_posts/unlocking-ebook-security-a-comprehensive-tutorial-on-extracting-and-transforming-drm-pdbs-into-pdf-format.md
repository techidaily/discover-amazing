If you got some eBooks with .pdb suffix, like me, and you want to read these books on iPad or Kindle, but you don't know how to, then this article may help you.

In this post, I'm going to show you what's a pdb file, and how to remove drm from pdb, how to convert pdb to pdf, epub, mobi, etc.

### What's PDB File

The .pdb file is a database format used for the Palm OS platform (**Palm Database**). Palm Doc \[.PDB\], eReader \[-er.PDB\], Isilo \[-is.PDB\] are the three most common versions of the PDB format. We will get eBooks in PDB format if we purchase from ereader.com, Fictionwise.com or [BN.com](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/).

The format features RLE compression, and supports reflowable content. However it lacks some of the features compared with more modern eBook formats for example only providing a very basic contents table. And what's more important, PDB is a format mostly used to view books on Palm mobile devices but not on Sony eReader or iPad or even more mobile devices. So as you known pdb is not so convenient if we want to read them on any devices.

The best resolution is to **convert pdb to PDF** or **convert pdb to ePub**.

But here comes another fetal problem. Most PDB books we purchsed and downloaded that aren't free are encrypted with DRM--digital rights management--protection, a machanism that prevents you from using PDB on all your mobile devices. To reslove this problem, you should **Remove DRM from PDB** at first.

**Tips:**

Don't know whether your PDB files are DRM protected or not? Click the link [Check DRM of PDB books](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

Here I introduce you **how to remove drm from PDB Free with Calibre.**

### How to Remove DRM from PDB

Calibre DeDRM Plugin is a free DRM Removal tool. It can support both Windows and Mac OS X. Through Calibre Plugins you can also remove DRM from not only PDB but also PDF, AZW, MOBI, etc.

1Download Calibre

To be able to use the DeDRM plugin for calibre, it is necessary to install calibre first. The latest version can be downloaded from official site <http://calibre-ebook.com/download>

2Unzip DRM Removal Plugin file

UnZip the ZIP file you just downloaded. Open the folder called calibre and you should see a folder full of plugins. It contains all plugins required by Calibre to remove the DRM protection.

3Launch calibre

When it’s open, look at the icons on the top row. Click “Preferences” on the far right .

![click calibre preference](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/calibre-preference.jpg)

At the pop up window please select "Plugin" and run it.

![click calibre plugin](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/calibre-plugin.jpg)

Then in the center click "load plugin from file".

![load plugin from file](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/load-plugin-from-file.jpg)

And find the unzip file that you just decompressed. Here you just have to select the "eReaderPDB2PML\_vXX\_plugin.zip" plugin.

**![remove drm from pdb books with Calibre Plugin](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/remove-drm-from-pdb.jpg)**

The calibre will warn you the security risk, click "Yes" to go on the left job. Finally you will see the success notification. And then back to the Plugin center you can see the PDB DRM Removal.

![Calibre Plugin PDB DRM Removal](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/Calibre-Plugin-PDB-DRM-Removal.jpg)

Just shut down calibre and launch it again. Next time when you add ebook, it will remove DRM automatically.

Now all your pdb books are DRM free. But if you want to read them on iPad or Sony eReader, you have to convert pdb to PDF or ePub because they are the most common ebook formats.

Of course you can continue to use Calibre to convert PDB to PDF, ePub, mobi, azw3, etc. For details you can refer to the article below the link.

This doesn't work. It is impossible to convert an isilo pdb file to PDF. I have tried this method and every other method. If someone is able to figure it out, please share.
