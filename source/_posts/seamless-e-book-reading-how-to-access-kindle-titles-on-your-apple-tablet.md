If you want to put kindle books on iPad, there are 2 options that you can choose, and I will discuss them in detail in this post. From here you can know more information about Kindle and iPad.

### Option 1: Put Kindle books on iPad Kindle app

Though Amazon Kindle limit us to read kindle books on its own devices, such as Kindle Paperwhite, Kindle Fire, and so on, but Amazon also provide a free reading app for iPad so that we iPad users can directly read kindle books on iPad.

Tap your "App store" icon on iPad, then input "Kindle" to search the free Kindle reading app. After finding it, click to download and install this app for free. Before get the access to install, you should enter your Apple ID, don't forget it.

After installed, double-click to run it, for the first launch you should input your own Amazon account to register your Kindle app on iPad. Then you can see all your purchased kindle books listed and saved on this library. Tap the cover to download them.

After downloaded, you can tap to begin your reading within this app.

### Option 2: Put Kindle books on iPad iBooks app

We know that iBooks is definitely the best reading app on iPad, so if we can put kindle books to this app, it would be a wonderful reading journey.

But the problem is that Kindle prevent us using non-Kindle app to read their books. How can they achieve this?

#### **Firstly, Kindle DRM:**

Almost all the Kindle books are protected by DRM. Amazon applies the DRM scheme to protect Kindle books, which limit us to copy, transfer, and share with friends, family members.

#### **Secondly, Kindle Format:**

Kindle books have their own formats, kfx, azw3, mobi, azw, prc, etc. They can only be supported on Kindle devices and apps. But, you know, the common ebook formats are EPUB and PDF, they can be read on many eReaders and apps, such as Kobo, iPad, Sony, Nook, android, etc.

But don't worry, here I will recommend you a good tool to help you make your kindle books convertible. It combines the best DRM Removal function with the ebook conversion feature.

It's [Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/). Download it for free at first.
