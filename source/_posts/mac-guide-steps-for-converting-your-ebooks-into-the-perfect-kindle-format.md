If you are using an e-Reader, I guess it's probably a Kindle device, because Amazon Kindle has been the most popular eReader at present. But sometimes, we purchased books online may be PDF or EPUB format, which are not supported by Kindle. So, in order to read EPUB or PDF files on Kindle, we need to convert eBooks to Kindle format. This guide tells you an easy way to convert eBooks to Amazon Kindle. Just 3 simple steps. 

### Step1: Get the tool ready

To convert eBooks to Kindle, we need an eBook converter tool first. Currently, there are many eBook converters on the market, such as Calibre and online eBook converter, but usually they can only support DRM-free books conversion, while the books we purchased online are always with Adobe DRM. So, if we convert DRM-protected books to Kindle, we may need to install 2 software: eBook Converter and DRM Removal. I guess most of us don't want to install much app on our computer.

Fortunately, I have found a powerful program [Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) which can help us convert both DRM-free and DRM-protected eBooks to Kindle. Only the 1 tool can solve all the 2 problems: format and DRM. With its key features: clean interface, batch conversion, high quality, detect books automatically, we can easily convert eBooks to Kindle without quality losing.

Download the tool for free

###  Step2: Remove DRM from EPUB or PDF eBooks

As I have mentioned above, before we convert EPUB and PDF eBooks to Kindle format, we have to remove Adobe DRM first. Except Ultimate, we also need another program [Adobe Digital Editions](http://www.adobe.com/solutions/ebook/digital-editions/download.html). Opening and reading downloaded books with it help the tool find the key to decrypt DRM books.

Have not installed it on your computer? Please download and install it now. Then authorize your computer with Adobe ID, make sure you can open and read your downloaded books with ADE. For detailed information, please read the guide [how to read books on ADE](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

#### 1Run Ultimate Converter

If your books are synced via ADE and saved in the default folder, the software will detect your books automatically and upload them to the program, you can see them under "ADE" icon.

If your books don't appear in the right frame, you can click "Setting" icon to set your book path or just drag books from the folder which saves your EPUB and PDF books.

**ADE default path:**

**For Windows:** ...\\My Documents (Documents)\\My Digital Editions ...

**For Mac:** Users/Your computer name/Digital Editions ...

Cannot find books in the default folder? 

**For Windows:** Right-click books on ADE, select "Item info".

**For Mac:** Select a book on ADE, Click "File"-->"Item info".

#### 2Remove DRM from EPUB or PDF eBooks

It's easy to handle. Just drag books from the right side to the left panel of the tool, then all your books will be decrypted soon. The word "decrypted" means your books have been removed DRM successfully.

### **Step3: Convert eBooks to Kindle format Mac**  

After we have decrypted EPUB or PDF files, now we can start converting eBooks to Kindle format. One advantage of this tool that I must point is that it provides us flexible output format choice. We not only can choose Amazon device such as Kindle Touch, Kindle Paperwhite, Kindle Fire as output format, which can makes the converted files suit our Kindle device best, but also can select Mobi as output format and convert eBooks to Kindle Mobi. Very friendly design, isn't it?

Then just tap "Convert" button to start conversion, when the books have been converted to Kindle format, a window will pop up automatically, which shows all your converted files. No need to find the books by ourselves. This can save us much time.
