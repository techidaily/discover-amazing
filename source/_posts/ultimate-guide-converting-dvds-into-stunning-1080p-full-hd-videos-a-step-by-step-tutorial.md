##  What is Standard DVD Resolution? 

There are two resolutions that the [DVD format](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) can support - 720x480 pixels per frame for NTSC and 720x576 pixels per frame for PAL. Accordingly, DVD is generally regarded as a standard resolution format. 

## Part 1\. Upscale DVD 480p to 1080p? Not Recommended! 

_"I have a question about should I upscale DVD to 720p resolution? My old NTSC DVD looks terrible and interlaced. I tried Handbrake but it doesn't improve the resolution. Is there any thing I can do to fix that DVD?"_

 Upscaling sounds like to be an effective solution to improve quality. Even the source DVD offers a resolution of 720x480, the quality could be possibly improved by taking advantage of the process and change the DVD resolution from 480p to 720p or 1080p HD. Is that really true? Hold on. 

To be frank, upconveting DVD to HD video in 1080p or 720p **cannot add more details than is already present**. The visual experience depends the resolutions of not only your source DVD but also your equipment used. The 480p movie viewing experience on your HDTV will never look crisper than that on your smartphone. In contrast, **visual artifacts and distortion will be noticed** when you are closer to your HDTV or other bigger screen monitor. Meanwhile, by ripping DVD to HD 720p/1080p video, the resolution is enhanced, which also leads to file size increase, and at a result, you will need more storage space to store the movie. So we don't recommend you upscale DVD resolution to HD 720 or 1080p.

## Part 3\. FAQs about DVD to HD Ripping 

### 1\. Can a DVD be 1080P?

Technically speaking, it is possible for DVDs to have 1080p quality videos on them. Yet, the reality is that they most commonly have 480p video quality. That is because the storage space needed for a 1080p movie would be too much for the disc to hold and so it would require using multiple discs to hold a single movie.
