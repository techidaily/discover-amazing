Notice that the file size must be under 50MB. And Amazon also limit the number of documents you send or store, but they don't say the exact quantity, I think it's enough for personal use.

### Step1\. Find Your Kindle Personal Email Address

When I surf on internet, I found there are many people don't know their Kindle email address, Infact, you can find your Kindle personal email address on Kindle eReader or Amazon website.

Find Kindle Personal Email Address on eReader 

Tap "Settings" --> "Device options" --> "Personalize your Kindle" --> "Send-to-Kindle Email"

Find Kindle Personal Email Address on Amazon website 

Go to Amazon website, find ["Manage Your Content and Devices"](https://www.amazon.com/myk). Click "Your Devices", and you will see all your Kindle devices, including your Kindle Reading App, such as Kindle for android, Kindle for iOS.

Click the device or app you want, and you will see the Kindle personal email address. Normally, it ends with @kindle.com.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Step2\. Add Your Email to "Send to Kindle" Approved Email list. 

To prevent spam, Kindle Personal Documents Service only accept email which approved by yourself, so you need to add your personal email address.

Go to Amazon [Manage Your Content and Devices](https://www.amazon.com/mycd). From Settings column, scroll down to Personal Document Settings. Under Send-to-Kindle Email Settings, your Send to Kindle email address will be listed. Click "Add a new approved e-mail address", enter a new email address, and then click Save to save your changes.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**Notice:** If you want to save your personal ebooks and documents to Kindle account, don't forget to enable archive, just simply click "Edit Archive Settings".

### Step3\. Compose an Email and Attached Your Books or Documents 

1\. Log in your approved email account, compose a new email. 

2\. Recipient is "_xxx@kindle.com_" which can be found on Kindle eReader and Amazon Website.

3\. Leave the subject and content as blank or write whatever you like.

4\. Upload your personal books and documents, and then click "send". 

**Tips:** If you want to convert PDF or txt to the Kindle compatible format, type "convert" in the subject when e-mailing a personal document to your Send-to-Kindle address.

### Optional: Email Books and Documents to Kindle from Calibre

If you use Calibre to manage your books, you can also email your books and documents from Calibre. Go to Perference >> Sharing books by email to set up the email address.

![sharing books by email](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/sharing-books-by-email.png) 

Next time, when you want to email a book or document to Kindle directly from Calibre, you just need to right click the title and find Connect/share >> Email to _xxx@kindle.com_. Then the title will be delivery to your Kindle device or app. 

####  Why can't i send EPUB to Kindle email? 

By default, you can send ePub to Kindle by email as amazon kindle now supports ePub format since 2022\. 

If you still failed or met some problems, please check whether your ePub books are drm protected or not. Kindle only supports drm free ePub books and convert ePub to kindle format with its send to kindle service. Don't forget to [try the Epubor Ultimate to help remove ePub drm](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) from your eBooks. 

Another tips, based on my own tests, sending ePub to Kindle for web is more convenient than emailing service.

Almost set up my book on kdp but keeps rejecting cover as lettering not small enough in spite of repeated efforts by professional designer.  
 Serious problem is that I cannot make new chapters start always on the right. Something to do with page breaks, insert blank page or header/footer.  
 Can anybody help please?
