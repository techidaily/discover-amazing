HTML(HyperText Markup Lanuage) is the standard markup language to create web page while Mobi is a file format created by Mobipocket but now also adopted by Amazon Kindle Readers. You may need to convert HTML to Mobi when you want to read files saved from wabpage on your kindle devices just like reading other ebooks instead of reading them in the browser. Or you have written your own ebooks with HTML format and want to share them with your family and friends who own the popular kindle devices.

You may find there are so many ways which are said to be able to convert HTML to Mobi. After my test, I finally collect three effective methods for you to convert HTML to Mobi. You can choose whichever one you prefer.

Updated 22/9/2017--We are glad to recommend you a new way to[**convert HTML to mobi with EpubPress**](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/). 

### Method 1: Convert HTML to MOBI online

You don't need to install any software by using online converter tools to convert HTML to Mobi. I have found three most effective online converter tools for you.

#### 1Online-convert

Visit this website <http://ebook.online-convert.com/convert-to-mobi>. You can simply upload your HTML document or enter URL of the HTML file you want to convert to Mobi and then hit "Convert file" at the bottom to start the conversion process. The conversion time depends on the your file size. After the conversion has finished, your converted file will be downloded automatically to your computer. You can find it in your "Documents"\\"downloads" item.

#### 2Office Converter

Go to this website <http://www.office-converter.com/HTML-to-MOBI>. You can easily figure out how to add HTML files and then hit "Convert". As the picture shows, you can preset items like "Target ebook reader". In this way you can directly convert HTML to kindle. You can also preset "Change Ebook Title, Author, input encoding" items. After the conversion job has been done, you will see a "download" button.
