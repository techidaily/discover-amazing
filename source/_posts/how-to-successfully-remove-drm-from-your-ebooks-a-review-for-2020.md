Learning something about the eBook DRM removal will benefit you a lot. As the fact that many of the eBooks we purchase and download from the mainstream eBook stores like Amazon, Kobo, Nook, Google Play are protected with DRM, we are always limited by eBook DRM. We cannot read those ebooks freely on any software or device we like, cannot choose the format we like or the format to read, and cannot share good ebooks with our families and friends. It's a great pain if the eBook is DRMed, isn't it? So follow me to know several DRM removal tools and get your locked books free.

### 2\. Calibre DeDRM Plugins

Calibre is a good eBook manager to a certain degree. Many people may have already installed Calibre on their computer long before. It can be used to remove eBook DRM together with the DeDRM plugins, but the processe is really complicated. Anyway, I will tell you how to remove DRM with Calibre first and then you make your own choice to get a DRM removal. 

**1\. Support OS**: Windows, Mac, Linux.

**2\. Support formats**: EPUB, PDF, MOBI, PRC, azw3, FB2, LIT, PDB, etc.

**3\. DRM schemes handling including**: Kinlde DRM, Adobe DRM.

**4\. How to use it to remove DRM**:

_Step 1\. Download [Calibre.](http://calibre-ebook.com/download)_

_Step 2\. Download [DeDRM Plugins.](http://download.epubor.com/DeDRM%5Fplugin.zip)_

_Step 3\. Add the downloaded DeDRM Plugins to Calibre by clicking "Preferences" -> "Plugins" -> "Load plugin from file". Select your already downloaded Calibre plugin file "DeDRM\_plugin.zip" to it._ 

![load plugin from file](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/click-load-plugin-from-file.png)

Then it will come up a window asking if you are sure to proceed to install the plugins. Just ignore the warning message and click the "Yes" icon to continue.

Next there will be a noticing window to tell you that the plugins installation has succeeded in Calibre. Click "OK" icon to finish.

_Step 4\. Remove DRM from eBook._

Now restart Calibre and add your DRMed books to it. Usually it will remove the books' DRM automatically. If your DRMed books are already in your Calibre library, you should remove them from Calibre first and then re-add them to Calibre, or their DRM will not be removed. 

For more details, please refer to the article [Calibre DRM Removal Plugins](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

### Conclusion

If you are really accustomed to using Calibre all the time, you can consider to add the DRM Removal plugins to Calibre and remove eBook DRM. When I was trying this way to remove DRM, I failed to remove the DRM sometimes. So I personally don't like DeDRM plugins much. Besides, the whole process is a little bit difficult for most of us. It's better to choose Epubor Ultimate to remove eBook DRM. It's born to be a DRM removal tool for eBooks, isn't it?

Unfortunately, the iBooks DRM removal tool Requiem v4.1 no longer works in Mac Mojave - which, to be fair, isn't listed on their webpage as a supported version of MacOS. Your article is from 2017.

 Is there an equivalent that still works on 2020 that you know of?

I'm so sorry if this is a dumb question but I've read so many articles and some say you can and some say you can't....I have an iPad mini from several years ago with tons of iBooks. I've downloaded them all to my PC with the purpose of removing the DRM so I can read them through the kindle app on my Samsung tablet. Is there ANY program that will allow me to do this so I can read my books purchased through the iTunes store years ago on something other than my iPad? At this point even having an app that will read them on the Samsung tablet without removing the DRM. I'd like them all in the kindle app for convenience but I'll take anything right now.
