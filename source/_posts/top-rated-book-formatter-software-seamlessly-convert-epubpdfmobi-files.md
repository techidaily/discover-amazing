**AZW:** AZW was released by Amazon in late 2011\. It is the successor to the Mobi?format, and has been updated to include a variety of new features and function. It's used only on the?Amazon Kindle?and Kindle app that are not compatible with EPUB format.

**PDF:** PDF is a commonly used format. It is widely used by a large number of retailers. eBooks with this format can be read on most of the eBook Reader, such as Kobo, Nook, Sony and Google.

### **How to convert eBook format**  

After learning about the basic functions of this eBook Converter, now it's time to convert eBook format with it. It's very easy, just 3 simple steps. If you are using Mac computer, you can try [Epubor eBook Converter Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ebook-converter/) to finish the following steps.

#### Step1: Drag books to the main interface of this tool

Usually, once we run this tool, our downloaded books will be uploaded automatically, if they are saved in the default folder. We can see "Kindle", "ADE", "Kobo", "Nook" icon at the right side of the program. Our books will appear under them.

**Books don't appear in the right frame?** 

If we cannot see our books in the right side, it may because they are not saved in the default folder. It doesn't matter. We can just drag books from the folder which saves our downloaded books to the main window. 

Or click "Setting" icon at the right corner of this software to set our eBook path, and tap "Browse" button to select the folder which saves our eBooks. Then all the books will show up in the right side.

Hello,

 You can't directly deal with KFX extension until now, but here is an solution:

 Sycn the KFX extension books via Kindle for PC/Mac. If so, the synced books won't be .kfx but the .azw

 It's easy to deal with Kindle AZW books, right?
