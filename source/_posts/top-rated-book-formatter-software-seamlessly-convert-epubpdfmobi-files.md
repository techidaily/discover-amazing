Or click "Setting" icon at the right corner of this software to set our eBook path, and tap "Browse" button to select the folder which saves our eBooks. Then all the books will show up in the right side.

Hello,

 You can't directly deal with KFX extension until now, but here is an solution:

 Sycn the KFX extension books via Kindle for PC/Mac. If so, the synced books won't be .kfx but the .azw

 It's easy to deal with Kindle AZW books, right?
