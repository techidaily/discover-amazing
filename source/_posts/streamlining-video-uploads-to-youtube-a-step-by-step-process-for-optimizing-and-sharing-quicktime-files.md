Generally speaking, with QuickTime installed on Mac, you are allowed to **post QuickTime videos to YouTube** without worrying about the video format and resolutions, for QuickTime videos, or MOVs, are natively supported by YouTube. However, cases are always exceptions to the rule. 

As QuickTime file is comparatively large in size, all you need to do is to guarantee your QuickTime file smaller than **2GB** and less than **15 minutes** in length by default. Then make sure your QuickTime video is encoded in H.264 and AAC that YouTube accepts well. Or else, you probably encounter nothing but Waterloo.

 Generally speaking, MOV is just slightly bigger than MP4 in size when it comes to use the same codec.

 What's plus, ProRes 422 is the highest quality standard to upload to YouTube. If your QuickTime ProRes mov file is encoded by ProRes 422 HQ or ProRes 4444/XQ, you're demanded to convert QT MOV ProRes to H264 codec for compatibility.
