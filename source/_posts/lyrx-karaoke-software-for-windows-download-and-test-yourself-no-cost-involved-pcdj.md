**LYRX for MAC (only) has been available for the last year and a half; now there’s a public beta for Windows you can download and take for a test drive.**

LYRX 1.4 for Windows is ready for download as a public beta, which means we’ve tested it thoroughly in-house and we’re ready for the masses to have a go. LYRX is built on the DEX 3 technology, which is designed for Windows and MAC, so we can state with supreme confidence that LYRX for Windows will perform as it should on Windows 7, 8/8.1, and 10.

LYRX is modern and snappy karaoke software for professional use, with all the features pro’s need to host karaoke with ease and precision. Included is managed singer rotation, singer/song history, automatic filler music player, a robust (and lightning quick) browser with search, key control, and much more. Unlike most karaoke show hosting solution it also has native support for all video file types, including the ever-growing-in-popularity MP4 karaoke file format.

If you need karaoke music, LYRX and Party Tyme Karaoke have you covered there, too. Subscribe to the entire Party Tyme catalog with the $99-a-month (commercially legal) karaoke subscription, or purchase and download karaoke songs on-the-fly from the new built-in Karaoke.net store.

We invite KJs that use Windows to download and try the new LYRX public beta version 1.4 below. The trial version is fully functional, but will require a restart every 20 minutes while in trial mode. LYRX is currently priced at only $39.95, but that won’t last long. Look for an upward change in price early 2019.
