For an iBooks lover, it's really a good joy to read iBooks on iPad, isn't it? But, when on a tour, at the office room, on a bus, and so on, don't you think reading books holding a heavy iPad is too tired?

Often at this time, I prefer to Kindle eReader rather than an iPad, for Kindle is more lightweight, more friendly to eyes.

So here comes our need: **transfer books from iPad to Kindle**. I will share the easy way for you to resolve it step by step, including the reason for this.

### 2 Problems we must face before transferring from iPad to Kindle

#### **Problem 1: Books in iBooks are not allowed to transfer.**

Most of our purchased books from iBooks bookstore are forbidden to copy, transfer, and share. Apple put their own DRM (copy protection) on those books. So we cannot move books from iPad to kindle.

#### **Problem 2: Books in iBooks are epub or pdf, not kindle format.**

All the books we bought from iBooks are epub format or pdf format, while Kindle devices only support Kindle's own format, such as mobi, azw3, azw, azw4, prc. So even though we can copy our books from iPad to kindle, we still can't read them on kindle, because we can't find a right reading app to open them.

We have found the problems, so if we could resolve the problems, we can reach our goal, yes? Let's come to the "how to" part you may be most interested in.

### Step1: Make books on iPad DRM free

Firstly, connect your iPad with your computer by USB. In common you will see the iTunes on your ![make ibooks drm free](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/ipad-books-drm-free.jpg)computer. Yes it says that your purchased books on iPad are saved at this library. Here tell you the default path to find the folder easy: \\My Documents\\My Music\\iTunes\\iTunes Media\\Books.

Then, use [this tool](https://digiex.net/threads/requiem-4-1-remove-itunes-drm-fairplay-from-music-video-and-books.11796/) to remove drm from your iBooks.

After finished, you will get all your books on iPad non-DRM. They are convertable to any formats.

I know this is an old article but hoping it still works. I bought most books on my iPad because of the bigger screen. I've since gotten the new kindle fire 10 and prefer to use it over my iPad. It's big, but lightweight. It's a shame Apple has to be so greedy and manipulate consumers. It's no wonder they're under fire for other unethical actions. I read a lot and wish I had done more research into what platform to use.   
 Until App!e allows customers to read iBooks on a kindle, then I will never buy another iBook.
