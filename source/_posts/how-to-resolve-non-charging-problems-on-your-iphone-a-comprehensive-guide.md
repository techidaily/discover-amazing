Software Solutions to iPhone Won't Charge

Before dealing with iPhone not charging or charging slowly, you'd better check the charging hardware is working properly. Make sure,

* You use the original Apple charger and USB cable. Other chargers may be not compatible with iPhone, leading to iPhone charging slowly, not charging, or iPhone not completely charging.
* The lightning cable, charging port, and adapter are fine. Switch to other charging port and USB cable to test.
* Brush the waste out of the charging port on the bottom of your iPhone. If you find no sign of damage to the accessories, scroll down to try more software-related solutions.

**1\. Disconnect and Reconnect iPhone to the Charger**

Unplug your iPhone and then plug firmly Apple charging cable into your iPhone. Make sure the charger is properly and securely connected. We also recommend you to try a different outlet to check if the outlet is the cause of the iPhone charging issue. Then let the iPhone charge for at least half an hour.

**2\. Perform A Force Restart**

A simple restart can fix tons of iPhone problems. Steps to restart your device depends on the model of iPhone you are using. Force restarting and rebooting mean the same thing. Use steps provided by Apple to [force restart your iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208078).

Updating apps may also help get rid of the issue. Open the App Store, and go to the Updates category, select Update next to the app. Then restart your iPhone and check if it charges. 

**4\. Reset your iPhone Settings**

Some improper settings may affect the charging system on iPhone. Try to [reset your iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/).

Move on to the next steps your iPhone still won't charge on Mac/PC, in the car or when plugged into charging cable.

**5\. More Complicated Solutions But Properly Your Last Stop**

\* Restore your iPhone to factory settings. A factory reset is commonly considered as the last option when facing with iPhone problems. [Back up your iPhone data](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) since restoring will remove all the data on the iPhone. 

\* Downgrade iOS. If your iPhone experiences charging [issue after iOS update](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), the iOS downgrade may work. On the contrary, for some users, updating to the latest version of iOS.

\* Put your iPhone into DFU mode (Device Firmware Upgrade mode). This allows your iPhone to be restored from any state. 

\* Take your iPhone to the Apple Genius bar for evaluation or get your iPhone replaced or repaired if all the above methods failed.
