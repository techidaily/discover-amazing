### Sync books to ipad

Launch iBooks and Sync the iPad device. Then your digital books will be transferred to it. Moreover the ability to synchronise to my iPad through iTunes is totally perfect. Select your iPad in iTunes and select the Books tab. After confirming your new .epub book is listed, click the Sync button. It does cover PDF to EPUB files so that the iPad can read them. Now run iBooks on your iPad. It’s amazing. The EPUB book automatically appears on your iBooks bookshelf.
