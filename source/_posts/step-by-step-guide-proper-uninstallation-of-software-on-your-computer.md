I have upgraded my system and did a clean install of Windows 11\. Prior to reinstalling Windows I uninstalled all of my apps but Epubor Ultimate does not allow me to use my existing license. How do I deregister this app for a fresh install?  

[Epubor not using default output format](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 12/10/2023 9:30:19 AM 

I have Epubor Ultimate set to use AZW3 output but it is persistently converting new files to EPUB. I have tried many settings and also tried uninstalling and re-installing; I can not get Epubor to always output AZW3.  
 Manual conversion from EPUB to AZW3 works without a problem.
