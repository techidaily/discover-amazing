We can can't make a decision for you, but this article certainly will help you to know more about kindle, ibooks and nook which will make it much easier for you to choose one from the three. You can make the decision according to your personal preferences and the actual situation.

### 1\. DRM 

 DRM is short for Digital Rights Management, but most of us may consider a more apt definition would be Digital Restrictions Management. That's because DRM restricts what you can do with your purchased digital media and ebooks especially. Currently there are several main DRM forms that affect ebooks, including Adobe Adept DRM, Nook DRM, Kindle DRM, iBooks DRM, ect.

![ebook drm](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/ebook-drm.jpg)

**1\. Kindle — Kindle DRM**: Amazon adopts their own proprietary DRM for Kindle Books. Most of the DRM kindle books are in AZW format and there are also a few TPZ. This DRM scheme restricts the way of reading these ebooks.You can read kindle DRM books on a Kindle device or a device using Kindle software (Kindle for PC, Kindle for Mac and so on).

**2\. iBooks — Apple iBooks DRM**: Apple uses their own form of DRM on ebooks purchased from the iBookstore. These books can only be read on Apple products such as an iPad, iPhone, iPod etc. No other softwares or devices are supported.

 **3\. Nook — Nook DRM or Adobe DRM**: This is where it may get us confused. Barnes&Noble Nook uses their own Nook DRM as well as Adobe DRM. If you have ever purchased ebooks from Nook store, you may get some ebooks that are in Nook DRM or Adobe DRM. If the ebooks are in Nook DRM, then they can only be read on Nook eReaders or Nook software like Nook for PC, Nook Study etc.

You may already have met the DRM problem before or right now. You can see that DRM is really a pain for readers. You cannot enjoy the books freely, you are always restricted by it. Cannot transfer books to other devices, cannot change ebook formats. Want to fix this? [All DRM Removal--Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) will help you out.

### 2\. eBook Prices 

Here I load the prices of some recent hot books from amazon, ibooks and nook. You can read carefully and maybe you will know where to get the relatively cheaper books. 

| **Brands**                                   | **Amazon Kindle** | **iBooks** | **Nook** |

| The Secret Place by Tana French              | $11.99            | $11.99     | $11.99   |
| If I Stay by Gayle Forman                    | $4.99             | $4.99      | $7.99    |
| Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn                   | $7.99             | $7.99      | $7.99    |
| Outlander by Duana Gabaidon                  | $4.99             | $4.99      | $7.99    |
| One More Chance by Abbi Glines               | $7.59             | $7.99      | $7.59    |
| The Maze Runner by James Dashner             | $5.99             | $5.99      | $7.99    |
| Fall of Giants by Ken Follett                | $2.99             | $2.99      | $2.99    |
| The Fault in Our Stars by John Green         | $4.99             | $4.99      | $7.99    |
| Where She Went by Gayle Forman               | $4.99             | $4.99      | $7.99    |
| Mean Streak by Sandra Brown                  | $12.99            | $9.99      | $12.99   |

From the chart above, we can see that the prices of most of the books in Amazon and iBooks are almost the same. Three of them are not the same prices. But you must notice that many books from Nook are relatively more expensive. For myself, I like to download and buy books from Amazon most. Amazon has a really large quantity of books, and the prices are not so expensive. Anyway, it depends on you to decide which way to buy books. And it needs more time and energy to find out where to get the cheapest books.

### 3\. Apps

#### **1\. The Kindle**

![kindle](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/kindle.jpg)

**Pros:**

It is a lightweight device, which is more convenient to carry with.  
 It offers a rather long battery life. For continuous active use, it can last for a whole day. For just standby, a week and so is normal.  
 An really easy-to-read screen, friendly to our eyes.  
 The Amazon gift cards can be used to get a lot of different things. You can buy a 10 left for another thing.

**Cons**:  
 Media is stored on the cloud. The Wi-Fi condition is important. No Wi-Fi means no media.  
 The "Web Browser" and "Text to speech" features are seemly not mature enough. So there is a reason why they’re called experimental. 

#### **2\. The iPad(iBooks)**

![ipad](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/ipad.jpg)

<a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135354/19272" target="_top" id="2135354">
  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135354" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/>

<img height="0" width="0" src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135354/19272" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**Pros:**

Compared with the original Nook or Kindle, it can do much more now.   
 iBooks is a great app for ebook lovers, as long as you meet the hardware and the iOS requirements.  
 The touch screen of ebooks allow you to interact with your media. 

**Cons:**  
 Usually you need to pay for tech support. This is also known as Apple Care at a rate of $99 for three years.

#### **3\. The Nook**

![nook](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/nook.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2098704/14409" target="_top" id="2098704">

<img height="0" width="0" src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2098704/14409" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**Pros:**  
 You can pick up one directly in the store, no waiting and no shipping costs.  
 Support is also offered in the store. Issues will be examined and resolved right away. 

**Cons:**  
 Nook tech support can bereally dumb. Many users have reported problems with support.  
 The screen does have a little bit of a sheen that can be a problem in a very high light condition.

This may help you to know more about Kindle, iBooks and Nook, but it cannot help you to decide which one to choose. You can take this article as a reference and make your own choice.
