Every OS ships with a plain text editor â€“ even DOS had one. Text is the only file format that you are guaranteed to be able to read on just about any system. This is why README files are always written in plain text. There is nothing easier than doing search and replace on plain text files. It's easy, fast and efficient. Plain text is also extremely easy to parse and filter. Besides, there are few data formats more efficient at storing information than textfile. So in this article I am going to show you how to convert epub to txt. 

### Compare EPUB with TXT

EPUB

EPUB is an e-book file forma with the extension .epub that can be downloaded and read on devices like smartphones, tablets, computers, or most e-readers, like Apple's iBooks, Kobo, Adobe Digital Editions, Barnes & Noble's Nook. EPUB is the most widely supported vendor-independent XML-based e-book format; that is, it is supported by the largest number of hardware readers. The EPUB format is an open standard. That means it is free and publicly available though there are specific rules for its usage.

TXT

A TXT file is a standard text document that contains unformatted text. It is recognized by any text editing or word processing program and can also be processed by most other software programs. Because of their simplicity, TXT files are useful for storing information in plain text with no special formatting beyond basic fonts and font styles. The file is commonly used for recording notes, directions, and other similar documents that do not need to appear a certain way.

Compare epub to txt, textfile has definite advantages over epub files.

1\. You don't have to worry if people can open them.

You don't need special software or tools to open a plain text file. If they're plain text, you're guaranteed that anyone can open them on any system. Plain text files have been around longer than many operating systems.

2\. Plain text files are light and fast.  

Text files doesn't contain fancy features like tables, pictures and macros, for this reason, they open quickly and easily. They're also smaller in size than proprietary word processing files, which makes them easier to email and share with others. 

3\. Plain text files are flexible

You can easily copy and paste the contents of a plain text file into any document or application. It's not possible to say the same about specialist applications that use proprietary databases or formats.
