![how to convert LIT to EPUB free via Calibre](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/how-to-convert-lit-to-epub-free.jpg)

Lit is the file format developed by Microsoft in 2000\. It's an ebook format used by the Microsoft e-Reader program to read eBooks. But it's not readable on iPad, iPhone, Adobe Digital Editions, Nook, Sony eReader, and so on. So if you want to read .lit file on various devices, you can solve this issue by converting LIT to the more common and popular ebook format like ePub. 

This is just what I want to write in this article. Though there are many tools that you can use to convert lit files, online LIT to EPUB converter or the third-party program tool. But through my trial I finally get a conclusion that the **Calibre is the best lit to ePub converter**.

\-Calibre is a free lit to epub converter.

\-Calibre can convert lit to pdf, convert lit to kindle, too.

\-Calibre is not only an ebook converter but also an ebook library manager.

\-And more ([full guide with calibre](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ebook-converter/)).

Here is the guide **how to convert LIT to EPUB free via Calibre**. It's my current preferred process.

### Step1: Install and Launch Calibre

Firstly[download Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/download) and select a proper version for your PC. Here we select "Windows". Download or copy your LIT eBooks on your computer please.

![downlaod and install calibre](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/download-calibre-to-convert-lit-files.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Step2: Add Microsoft LIT Files to Calibre

Drag and drop a few LIT e-book files into calibre, or click on the "Add Books" button at the upper left of the toolbar and browse for the LIT ebooks you want to work with. When you succeed in adding, the title of the ebook will show in the middle list.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Double click the file you want to select for a review before the ebook conversion.

For DRM-free LIT files, you can open directly, then convert to ePub.

![open drm free lit files](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/open-free-drm-lit-with-calibre.jpg)

But for DRM protected LIT files, it will pop up a window as the image shows below. This book is DRMed.

![open drm protected lit files](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/open-drmed-lit-with-calibre.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4531356&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8fdd149fcaa7058caccc9c4ad5b0d89a/products/tss-box.JPG" border="0">The Tube Sites Submitter is a fast and efficient tool for anyone who needs to upload videos quickly, easily and automatically to hundreds of tube sites in mere minutes . </a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
So if also receive this dialog when converting lit to epub, maybe you should remove drm from lit files. 

### Step 3: Convert LIT to EPUB: Calibre

Select the lit files, then touch the "Convert books" button.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Set "ePub" as output format at the new pop-up window. Then click "OK".

![convert lit to epub](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/convert-lit-to-epub.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
As the image shows, we can also set pdf as output format if we want to convert lit to pdf. Of course we can also convert lit to mobi and convert lit to azw. The formats calibre support are as below.

**Input Formats:** LIT, CBZ, CBR, CBC, CHM, ePub, FB2, HTML, HTMLZ, LRF, MOBI, ODT, PDF, PRC, PDB, PML, RB, RTF, SNB, TCR, TXT, TXTZ

**Output Formats:** ePub, FB2, OEB, LIT, LRF, MOBI, HTMLZ, PDB, PML, RB, PDF, RTF, SNB, TCR, TXT, TXTZ

Look to the bottom of the right corner. As soon as you see the message "Jobs: 0", it shows the conversion has completed.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
After the conversion is completed, you can see the ebook cover, including the output format (ePub) and original format (LIT), then click "Click it to open" to get your books.

![click lit files to open](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/click-lit.jpg)

Now you can transfer your converted LIT books to iPad, Nook, Sony e-reader, and so on. What do you think of this guide?
