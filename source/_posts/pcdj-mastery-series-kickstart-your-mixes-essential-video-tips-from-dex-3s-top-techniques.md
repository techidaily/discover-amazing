## PCDJ Mastery Series: Kickstart Your Mixes – Essential Video Tips From DEX 3'S Top Techniques

[![](https://i0.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/syncstart-coverimage.jpg?resize=530%2C298&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/syncstart-coverimage.jpg?fit=530%2C298&ssl=1 "syncstart-coverimage")

A unique feature exclusive to PCDJ [DJ Mixing software](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) is “**Sync Start**”

The purpose of **Sync Start** is much like Sync, to align two or more tracks at the same tempo and on-beat – which is possible thanks to the **beat-grid technology** found in DEX 3 and RED Mobile 3\. The basis of **beat mixing** is to seamlessly blend two tracks to make one, used often when transitioning from one track to another. Sync, likely the most polarizing feature found in DJ software today, makes this one-button-press easy (_selecting the right tracks to mix and when to mix them in is still critical_).

Sync is typically used when you’ve already started the deck, to match and align tempos on-the-fly. **Sync Start** not only aligns the tempos based on the beat-grid, but also starts the track from a full stop – _on beat_. If you’re playing a track in Deck A for example and click Sync on Deck B (_either with a DJ controller or keyboard/mouse_), the song will start, on beat and in sync with the playing track.

The **Sync Start** feature is especially useful if you’re nearing the end of a track and weren’t prepared to mix into your next track. Maybe you were distracted, or just couldn’t pick the right song to mix until too late; **Sync Start** will allow you to quickly load a track and mix it in instantly.
