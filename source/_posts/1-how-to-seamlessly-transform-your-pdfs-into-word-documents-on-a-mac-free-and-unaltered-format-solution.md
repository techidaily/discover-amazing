### Method 1: Mac-pre installed software—Mac Automator App 

![automator](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/automator.png)This method does not need you to install any software on your Mac but to use the pre-installed app--Automator to build a custom workflow to convert the PDF to plain text or RTF documents which can be open with Word.

Here is the step by step guide to help you convert PDF to Word on Mac with Automator.

**Step 1:** Run Automator, which can be found in your Application folder or Launchpad, select “application” and click on “choose”. 

![select application](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/select-application.png)

**Step 2:** Go to “PDFs” under “Action” tab at the left column and then click “Extract PDF Text” at the central column. Then drag and drop “Extract PDF Text” to the right column to build your workflow and a new window will pop up as below picture.

![Extract pdf text](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/Extract-PDF-TEXT.png)

Choose “Rich Text” as the output, select where you want to store your output file and choose the name option for your output file.

**Step 3:** Once this has done, please go to the file option and save it as below picture.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Please ensure the File format is Application, not Workflow. Then fill in “PDF to Word Apps” and choose where to store this application and mine is Desktop. When above has been done, click on “Save” button to generate the application.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**Step 4:** Now you have your own “PDF to Word Apps”. To convert the PDF to Word, you just need to drag and drop the PDF file on the top of the “PDF to Word Apps” and a new file with the.rtf will be created. You can use the Word to open this RTF file.

Once this “PDF to Word Apps” has been generated, you can convert any of your PDF to Word within seconds. The drawback of this method is it does not support batch conversion and can not handle scanned PDF files. What’s more, text format is the only output format you can choose.

### Method 2: Online PDF to Word Converter 

There are a variety of online PDF to Word converters for Mac available, and they are entirely free and very easy to use. However, it's crucial to conduct some research before utilizing their services because some lack privacy policies or disclaimers. You never know how they will handle your uploaded documents. If your PDF file contains business-confidential information, it's advisable not to use online services.

Here I have selected some real popular online PDF to Word Converters for your options.

PDFOnline -- <http://www.pdfonline.com/>  
 Zamzar --[http://www.zamzar.com/](http://www.zamzar.com/)  
 Smallpdf--<https://smallpdf.com/pdf-to-word>  
 OnlineOCR (for converting scanned PDFs) -- <http://www.onlineocr.net/>

Although the online PDF to Word conversion service is very convenient for users and money-saving. If you take the security concerns into consideration, you should really give this service up. Also, online conversion service will not give you well-quality converted file.

###  Method 3: Google Docs 

Google Drive offers online storage services, but its functionality extends beyond that. You might have overlooked its capability to convert PDF to Word. Today, I will show you how to convert PDF to Word on Mac using Google Docs. It is a safe, convenient, and easy-to-use method, but you need to have your own Google account.

**Step 1:** log in your Google Drive and upload the PDF file. When you log in your Google Drive, click on 'NEW' tab at the top left corner and then click on "file upload" button to choose the file from your Mac.

![upload file to google drive](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/upload-file-to-google.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

When the file uploaded successfully, a message will pop up at the buttom to remind you.

![upload file complete](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/upload-file-complete.png)

**Step 2:** find the uploaded file at the file list and right click the file title to select open with this file with Google Docs as the below picture.

![open with google docs](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/open-pdf-with-docs.png)

The PDF file will be open and can be edited now.

**Step 3:** Click "File" menu and Download this file as Microsoft Word(.docx). Now you will get this PDF file converted to Word.

![download pdf as word](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/DOWNLAD-pdf-as-word.png)

Google Docs can convert your PDF to Word while preserving the formatting of your converted documents. However, it requires an internet connection throughout the entire process. If you have your own Google account, you should give this method a try. Nevertheless, it doesn't support batch conversion and can be a bit time-consuming if you need to convert multiple files at once.

### Method 4: Calibre 

Calibre combines eBook converter with eBook management. As a freeware, Calibre enables you to convert eBooks from one format to another in the batch. So you can convert PDF to Word on Mac with Calibre.

**Step 1:** Download Calibre and install it. Please download the Calibre for Mac [here](https://calibre-ebook.com/download%5Fosx). and install it as its instruction.

**Step 2:** Add your PDF file to Calibre and then right click the PDF file title. Select “Convert Books” at the dropdown list and then you can choose “convert individually” or “Bulk convert” according to your requirements. 

![convert pdf to docx](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/calibre-convert-pdf.png)

**Step 3:** It will pop up a new windows so that you can edit the metadata of the PDF file. Please choose “DOCX” as the output format and then click on “OK” button. Calibre will start to convert the PDF file to Word. 

![select docx as the output format](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/select-docx-as-output-format.png)

Different from the other three methods, this one requires you to install software on your Mac first, but it is also completely free and easy to use. This method, particularly suitable for users with numerous PDF files to convert, supports batch conversion.

These are the four methods to convert PDF to Word on Mac that I want to share with you today. I'm aware there are other methods, such as Acrobat Pro DC, which is a professional PDF tool. With it, you can edit, convert, and sign PDFs, but its subscription fee is 14.99 USD per month. In my opinion, it is excessively expensive. Nevertheless, the converted Docx will never let you down!

Thanks for the sharing. I'd also recommend Acethinker PDF Converter which I have used for many years. It's a free web-based application to convert PDF, you don't have to install anything.
