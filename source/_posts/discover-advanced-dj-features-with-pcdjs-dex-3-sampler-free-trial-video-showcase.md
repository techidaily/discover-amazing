## Discover Advanced DJ Features with PCDJ's DEX 3 Sampler - Free Trial Video Showcase

**The totally redesigned [PCDJ DEX 3 DJ software](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) includes a relocated and improved sample player.** 

The sampler players in DEX 2 were somewhat inconveniently located within the browser section, so you had to swap the browser out for the sample decks to view them. The sample player in DEX 3 has a new home in the mixer section, so you can access it using the “_Sampler_” button located across the top of the 2 deck or 4 deck default DEX 3 skin.

You still have 8 trigger pads that allow you to load up sample clips so you can trigger and play them on-the-fly over-top a playing track, or while making a transition to another track. Samples can add layers to your mix, and allow you to add remix elements – further making the music “your own”. You can also use it for simple jingles, like applause or a gong…have fun with it!

[Here’s a link to a free DJ sample pack](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) compliments of our partners at the iDJPool to help get your sample collection started.
