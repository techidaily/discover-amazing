### Convert VBK to PDF on Windows

Unlike Mac, if you are using Windows system, there will not be a built-in printer preinstalled on your computer. As there are so many free PDF creation appliation on the market, why not install one on your Windows? I have used both doPDF and CutePDF. Both of them work well as a Virtual PDF printer on my own Windows.

#### Step 1: Install VitalSource Bookshelf app on your Windows

Go to [VitalSource Bookshelf](https://www.vitalsource.com)to download the desktop app and then install it on your Windows.

#### Step 2: Install doPDF on your computer

Download the FREE virtual printer driver doPDF [here.](https://dopdf-free-pdf-converter.soft112.com/quick-download.html) This virtual printer will allow you print files as regular printer, but the result will be a PDF, not a real paper.

#### Step 3: Print the VitalSource Books as PDF

Open the VitalSource Bookshelf and download the book you want to convert. Open the book and then click on "File"-->”“Print".

![print vbk to pdf](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/windows-print-VBK.png)

<a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134249/18498" target="_top" id="2134249">

<!-- affiliate ads end -->




The print preview window will pop up. You just have to click on "print" to go to the next step. 

![print options on windows](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/print-options.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->




Now you will see the print settings window. Choose "doPDF 9" as the virtual printer and select all pages. Then click on "Print".

<!-- affiliate ads end -->




After you have clicked on "Print", the doPDF will save this file as PDF. You can change the file name and storage at your computer by clicking on "Browse". Then click on "OK". The printer will begin to print this file and give you a PDF file.

![print vbk to pdf on windows](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/print-vbk-to-pdf-on-windows.png)

As there may be print limitation, you have to print the pages one by one. After all pages have been printed, you can use Epubor PDF & Merger & Splitter to merge all pdf files to one book.

This does work. You have to go to the section you want to save, then select print and the print range (max is 2 pages). This is not a real solution for books with several hundred pages though.

Good luck epubor. Can’t wait for you to resolve this. I have the book, why don’t they just listen their proprietary software sucks for simple reading and that’s why people don’t want to use it, not because we haven’t already day got the books!

 I want to run a pdf speed reader over it for a quick overview for the first read before a proper study... sigh.

Due to technical issue and copyright problems, we decide not to sell this software in the future.

Do you now have a better way of downloading THE WHOLE book? It's very important and very unprofessional to have this format of only 2 pages at a time, especially after paying money for this.

This solution allows 2 pages to be printed and so is a complete waste of time.

is safe to use this tool?  
 I'm afraid of getting banned or something.
